// Pre process data imported from external sources

1. Open Weka 3.6 click on Explorer.

2. Once you get a “Weka Explorer” window click on “Open File” and select the .csv database file you want to preprocess.

3. After the database is loaded, WEKA will automatically detect the attributes and show the visualization of each one of them at the bottom right panel.

4. Select the “id” attribute and click on “Remove” to remove the “id” attribute from the database. Now save the database.

5. Go to the newly saved database file and open it with wordpad.

6. Change the attribute value of “children” from “numeric” to {0,1,2,3} and save the file.

7. Open the newly saved file in WEKA. The continuous values of the attribute “children” are now discrete, as we have clustered the data in 4 discrete clusters.

8. Select the “age” attribute, go to “Filter”-Choose-filters-unsupervised-attributes, Select
Discretize.

9. Click on the Discretize Text-Box. In theGenericObjectEditor change the bins value to “3”, click on OK->Apply Button. In the visualization 3 clusters of “age” attribute is being created.

10. Open the database file with WordPad. Replace all the values of age attribute as shown in the figure below. Do the same for values of income attribute.
